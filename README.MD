# ChatBot

Well thats what it does.  This is the bot for my Twitch Channel...

This is a ChatBot using TwitchLib and a Vector C# Library to control Vector, he's a small robot.  Orginal launch by Anki now owned by Digital Dreanm Labs

The ChatBot is using TwitchLib to connect to the TwitchChat and allows people in the chat to make Vector speak and tell jokes and other things. It also captures links from chat and writes them to a FaunaDB database and also posts them into the channel's discord server for later reference.

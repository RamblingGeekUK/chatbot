# ChatBot

Well thats what it does.  This is the bot for my Twitch Channel...

This is a ChatBot using TwitchLib and a Vector C# Library to control Vector, he's a small robot. 

The orginal plan was for him to run on a RaspberryPi but it's now running on a Banna Pi Zero.... 
This bot is built using the following 

[TwitchLib] (https://github.com/TwitchLib/TwitchLib)
[Vector.NET] (https://github.com/zaront/vector)
